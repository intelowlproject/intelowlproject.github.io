## Introduction

The engineer in me always on a hunt for intersting prjects and products. One such project that caught my eyes was Honeynet's The IntelOwl Project. I'll keep this blog short and crisp elucidating all my contributions since then.

As it can be noticed, my contributions were pretty heavy on developing and fixing analyzers. Inevitabely, the project I chose was developing **New Analyzers for IntelOwl**.

In my proposal, I proposed to develop around 30 new analyzers for the community of IntelOwl users.

# GSoC Deliverables and Tasks

As anticipated, my proposal was selected and I was assigned the project. One of my mentors, and the owner of IntelOwl, Matteo created a [GitHub Project/Kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/intelowlproject/projects/11/). All individual issues solved, pull requests and commits cab be accessed using the board. 

I'll now proceed to elaborate on all the significant PRs mentioned.

### Blint Analyzer
[commit#2257](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl/pull/2257)


## Ending Note and Next Steps

Participating in GSoC has been an incredibly enriching experience. I gained far more knowledge than I anticipated, not only in technical aspects but also in communication and time management, particularly in handling unexpected challenges.

Throughout the program, my mentors provided invaluable support, ensuring smooth communication and timely resolution of any issues. This enabled me to stay on track and complete my tasks effectively.

Looking forward, I am eager to continue contributing to open-source projects, particularly within the IntelOwl organization. I have several ideas for new features to further enhance the project’s documentation site. It’s deeply fulfilling to contribute to the community that has been instrumental in my learning journey.
